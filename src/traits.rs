    Implementing a trait for a type

/*
    Clone and Copy

    Clone is for .clone() to copy all your data from one place in memory
    to another.

    Copy is for automatically cloning on function calls and other places
    so you don't have to worry about it.

    Q: Should we implement Copy for Person?
    A: Probably no, Person has String fields which are dynamically growable,
       so we don't really want to automatically copy large chunks of memory
       without making that explicit and making the user think about it.
       Copy is mainly used for integer, char, etc. data types.

    Q: Should we implement Copy for AddressBook?
    A: Even worse, definitely no.
*/

/*
    So far: to implement a trait, we have seen the #[derive(...)]
    syntax.

    What if we want a different implementation than the default provided
    by #[derive(...)]?

    #[derive(...)] is just magic that calls a macro to generate some code
    to implement your trait automatically in some canonical or "obvious" way.
    If you want something less obvious or different than the default,
    you can write that code yourself.
*/

// Let's take Eq as an example, what would be the automatically generated Eq
// code?
impl PartialEq for Person {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        self.name == other.name
            && self.age == other.age
            && self.phone == other.phone
            && self.favorite_color == other.favorite_color
    }
}

// But maybe we want to say two people are equal if they have the same name?
// impl PartialEq for Person {
//     fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
//         self.name == other.name
//     }
// }

// In general, the way you implement a trait:
// - First you look up the documentation or the source code for the trait
//   which will have a list of methods that you need to implement.
//   For example, Clone requires that you implement
//       fn clone(&self) -> Self
//   PartialEq requries that you implement
//       fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool
//   and so on.
//   Some traits have more than just one function.

// Let's try implementing display for our Person type

// Brief note:

/*
    Default

    Rust uses Default for objects which can be safely initialized automatically
    to some default value.

    If you implement Default, you are saying "it's fine to not initialize me, I
    will just be the default value in that case"

    Good example of NOT deriving a trait: by not implementing Default
    for Person, we indicate to users of our data structure or library
    that they should always initialize a Person. ==> compiler error
    if you try to use Person with an API that requires Default.

    But Default does make sense for AddressBook, because you can have
    an empty address book and that's fine.
